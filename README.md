# CheckIntegrity

It's a simple tool for checking integrity of a file by matching checksums with given strings.
It works with most hashing algorithms (`md5sum`,`sha1sum`,`sha256sum` etc).

# Dependencies

`md5sum`, `sha1sum`, `sha256sum` etc. (install only the ones you'll need).

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/SinTan1729/CheckIntegrity
cd CheckIntegrity
chmod +x CheckIntegrity
```

# Usage

The syntax is as follows :

`CheckIntegrity algo filename hash`

`algo` is the algorithm to use (e.g. md5, sha1, sha256 etc.)

`filename` is the relative/full path to file

`hash` is the given hash to match with

You can type `CheckIntegrity -h` for help.
